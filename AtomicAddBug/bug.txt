In mean_heurisitc_GPU function, when computing which cluster does each point belong to, we need to find mean for each cluster. 
Here since multiple threads may be trying to write to the same cluster's mean, there are chances of concurrency bugs.
Since there is no atomic floating point addition present in the cuda 5.*, this means that there is no correct way to do compute cluster means in parallel, except for computing local sums and then performing reduction on them.
