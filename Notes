It is very very important to export OMP_NUM_THREADS before running the program, else this will not be defined and program unusually seg faults

Writing d2_sample_2 with the assumption that in each run we get the same number of threads. This is needed so that the size of partitions remains the same throughout and I can use the cumulative distance array to optimize the procedure because distance value can change for a point only if it is smaller than the current value so we need not iterate over each center to find the minimum

Which random number generator do we use has an impact on the performance on the cost of the solution
MT19937 is better than using standard rand() function! Need to find its c variant and use it
